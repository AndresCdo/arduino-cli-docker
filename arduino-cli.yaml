# This YAML file contains configuration settings for the Arduino CLI tool.
# It specifies various options related to the board manager, daemon, directories,
# library, logging, metrics, output, sketch, and updater.

board_manager:
  additional_urls:
  - https://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package_staging_index.json
  # Additional URLs for the board manager package index. These URLs are used to
  # fetch additional board packages for Arduino boards.

daemon:
  port: "50051"
  # The port number on which the Arduino CLI daemon listens for incoming requests.

directories:
  data: /root/.arduino15
  # The directory where Arduino CLI stores its data, such as cache and preferences.

  downloads: /root/.arduino15/staging
  # The directory where Arduino CLI downloads and stages files before installation.

  user: /root/Arduino
  # The directory where Arduino CLI expects user sketches and libraries to be located.

library:
  enable_unsafe_install: false
  # Whether to enable unsafe installation of libraries. If set to true, Arduino CLI
  # will allow installation of libraries from unverified sources.

logging:
  file: ""
  # The file path where the log file should be written. If empty, logging is disabled.

  format: text
  # The format of the log messages. Possible values are "text" and "json".

  level: info
  # The log level. Possible values are "trace", "debug", "info", "warn", and "error".

metrics:
  addr: :9090
  # The address on which the metrics server listens for incoming requests.

  enabled: true
  # Whether to enable metrics collection. If set to true, Arduino CLI will collect
  # and expose metrics about its usage.

output:
  no_color: false
  # Whether to disable color output. If set to true, Arduino CLI will not use colors
  # in its output.

sketch:
  always_export_binaries: false
  # Whether to always export binaries when compiling sketches. If set to true, Arduino CLI
  # will export binaries even if the compilation fails.

updater:
  enable_notification: true
  # Whether to enable update notifications. If set to true, Arduino CLI will check for
  # updates and display notifications if a new version is available.
